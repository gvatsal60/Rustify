# Rustify - A Rust Project Template

Welcome to Rustify! ðŸ¦€

Rustify is a template for kickstarting your Rust projects. Whether you're a seasoned Rustacean or just getting started with the language, Rustify provides a solid foundation for building reliable and efficient software in Rust.

## Features

- **Cargo Integration**: Rustify leverages Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system, to manage dependencies and build your project.
- **Configured for Common Tools**: This template comes pre-configured with common tools and configurations such as Gitignore, Cargo.toml, and a basic project structure to save you time.
- **Testing Framework Included**: Rustify includes a testing framework setup, so you can start writing tests for your code right away.
- **Documentation Setup**: Rustify encourages documentation with a pre-configured setup for Rust's documentation generator, Rustdoc.
- **License**: A pre-configured Apache License file is included, allowing you to easily choose an open-source license for your project.
